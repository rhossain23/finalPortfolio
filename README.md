## Exploratory Project

#### Abstract: 

This project was concerned with visualizing all of the countries in which players that played at every World Cup play soccer professionally. Soccer players play for both a "national" team and a "club" team. National teams represent a country in international tournaments, such as the World Cup. Club teams, on the other hand, represent a city or a region within a country, and play within its countryâ€™s leagues. This project uses a map and a bar graph to visualize the data. It was inspired by a visualization by [Andy Kriebel](https://public.tableau.com/profile/andy.kriebel#!/vizhome/WorldCupPlayers/WorldCup).

#### Data: 

The data was obtained directly from [FIFA](https://www.fifa.com/)'s website, by way of the "references" sections on Wikipedia articles for every edition of the World Cup, such as the [1930 tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#References). These Wikipedia articles had links to archived reports on FIFA's website from every World Cup ever that provided all of the data I needed. The prospectus for my project talked about using data from Transfermarkt and WhoScored, two soccer statistics groups, but they did not have the data that I wanted. [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) was used to create the visualizations.

## Narrative Project

#### Abstract: 

This project was an extension of my exploratory project. While I was doing that project, I noticed that in the early years of the World Cup, most players would play their club soccer in the country that they represented at the tournament. However, as the years went on, more and more players from non-European countries would move to Europe and join European clubs, and so players that played club soccer in Europe became the largest group of players at the World Cup. This project explored this phenomenon with maps and graphs and offered a possible reason for this trend.

The prospectus for my project talked about using data from Transfermarkt and WhoScored, two soccer statistics groups, but they did not have the data that I wanted. I also included a visualization of the richest soccer clubs in the world, and I obtained this data from the [Deloitte Football Money League](https://www2.deloitte.com), again by way of the "references" section on the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte_Football_Money_League#References). [D3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) was used to create the visualizations.
