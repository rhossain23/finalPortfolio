# Exploratory Project

Abstract: This project was concerned with visualizing all of the countries in which players that played at every World Cup play soccer professionally. Soccer players play for both a "national" team and a "club" team. National teams represent a country in international tournaments, such as the World Cup. Club teams, on the other hand, represent a city or a region within a country, and play within its countryâ€™s leagues. This project uses a map and a bar graph to visualize the data. It was inspired by a viusalization by Andy Kriebel: https://public.tableau.com/profile/andy.kriebel#!/vizhome/WorldCupPlayers/WorldCup.

# Narrative Project

Abstract: This project was an extension of my exploratory project. While I was doing that project, I noticed that in the early years of the World Cup, most players would play their club soccer in the country that they represented at the tournament. However, as the years went on, more and more players from non-European countries would move to Europe and join European clubs, and so players that played club soccer in Europe became the largest group of players at the World Cup. This project explored this phenomenon with maps and graphs and offered a possible reason for this trend.
